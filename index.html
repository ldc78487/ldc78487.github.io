	<h2> <u>Family Life</u> </h2>
	<p> I was born in Wilmington, Delaware on November 14, 1998(20 years old). My parent's names are Marla and Jon Chalfie
		and I have one sibling, Lucy(16). We moved to Charleston, SC when I was 2 for my moms job at the Family Circle Cup
		running advertising, while my dad did commercial real estate. We went to the beach all the time since we only live 
		10 minutes away, it was a great family activity. Sports are a huge part of my family as every Sunday our family 
		watched the Cincinnati Bengals football game as all of our favorite sports teams are from Cincinnati due to that 
		being my parents birth place. We are not a religious family as my parents just aim to teach us good morals and people.
		I am extremely thankful for the opportunities my parents have given me and always having my sister as a best friend.
	</p>
	<h2> <u> Interest </u> </h2>
	<p> Growing up in the southeast with beautiful weather I loved to be outside playing sports. I played soccer form the age
		of 5 till I graduated high school with two state championships and one national. I also love to fish, growing up next 
		to the water it almost becomes second nature along with going on the boat. Water sports are one of my favorite activiies
		especially tubing. My favorite foods include pizza, sushi, and oysters and my favorite restaurant is O-ku, check out the 
		menu here <a href="http://o-kusushi.com/"> O-ku</a>. Another one of my hobbies is to read, I love to read books on how
		economics and the world works and the reasons behind it. Lastly I love to sleep, I take a nap almost everyday without
		it I struggle through my day. 
	</p>
	<h2> <u> Goals and Aspirations </u> </h2>
	<p> In five years I hope to be enrolled in a well respected law school working towards a graduate degree. Then 10 years from
		there I hope to be opening my own law firm in Charleston where I can begin to start a family. I would like to married before
		30 and have 3 kids in my life time. I also hope to be well traveled in my life I would love to see what other cultures are
		like outside of America and become less sheltered. Money is not something I place a ton of importance on but I do hope I
		live comfortably and can accumulate over one million dollars in charitable donations over my life. Last but certainly not
		least, at the bear minimum I would like to die a happy person with lots of people that love me and vise versa as I hope to
		leave a substantial impact on people in one way or another.
